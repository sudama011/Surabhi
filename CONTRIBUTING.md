## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code**: With Flutter and Dart plugins

### Installation

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click "Fork" on GitHub to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vhkmsurabhi_flutter.git
   cd vhkmsurabhi_flutter
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Generate Code**: 
The project uses json_serializable and build_runner. Run the following command to generate the necessary files:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```

5. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
     - For features:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - For bug fixes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
     ```

6. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow Dart and Flutter style guidelines.
   - Write clear comments where needed.
   - Follow the architecture and structure of the project.

7. **Write and Run Tests**
   - Add unit/integration tests for your changes.
   - Run all tests before committing:
     ```bash
     flutter test
     ```
8. **Check code style**
    ```bash
    flutter analyze
    ```

9. **Commit and Push**
   - Use clear, conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: add user registration`, `fix: resolve login issue`).
   - Push your branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

10. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Target the `develop` branch.
   - Provide a detailed description and reference related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
